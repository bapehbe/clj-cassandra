Cassandra clojure client library.
Inspired by clojure-cassandra project, while support new version of Cassandra (0.6.0-beta2).
I take a different approach to implement it, so it does not share any code with clojure-cassandra project.

Usage:

(use ['cassandra.client)

(def client (cdb/mk-client "localhost" 9160))
(def ks (mk-keyspace client "Keyspace1"))
(def cf (mk-cf ks "Standard1"))

;; Get Attribute
(get-attr cf "foo")

;; Set attribute
(set-attr! cf "foo" :hello "world!")
